## **Context:**
[Loggi](https://www.loggi.com/) is a Brazilian technology unicorn startup focused on logistics. Loggi started by delivering only documents between 2013 and 2014. Two years later, it entered the e-commerce segment. And since 2017, it has also been involved in food deliveries.

The Loggi Benchmark for Urban Deliveries (BUD) is a GitHub repository ([link](https://github.com/loggi/loggibud))  with data and code for typical logistics company problems: optimizing delivery routes, allocating deliveries to fleet vehicles with limited capacity, etc.

## **Objectives:**
Route Optimization and Resource Allocation:
The application of data analysis in Loggi's logistics operations can result in a more efficient operation, helping to optimize delivery routes, reducing the distance traveled by vehicles, and minimizing operational costs such as fuel and time, i.e., cost reduction.

Increased Efficiency:
In addition to providing greater visibility of the entire logistics operation flow, allowing the company to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement. This, in turn, reduces the chances of errors, enhances customer satisfaction, and strengthens the competitive position in the market. However, it is important to balance these benefits with the limitations and challenges inherent in logistics data analysis.
